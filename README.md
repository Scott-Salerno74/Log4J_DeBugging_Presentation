# Log4J_DeBugging_Presentation
Presentation on Log4J and Debugging for CDS390

I have re-created an attempt I made at making a puzzle game with some bugs that need to be fixed in the Process. While I am working on this, I have set up everything My team and I will need. 

Using Log4j and its debugging methods we will create a project that hopefully works and will give us tegh satisfaction of working and testing the bugs.
